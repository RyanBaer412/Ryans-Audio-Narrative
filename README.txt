# Ryans Audio Narrative
 
Summary
-This is a podcast about football, but not just football. I am focusing on the most important aspect of the game of football, the trenches also known as the offensive line. I dive into some aspects of offensive linemen that I believe that people do not quite understand, and also that people need to learn. I focused on what it is like being an offensive linemen and the mentality you need to have to be one. 
I used many of different ways to get my point across to the people, like how I used to in game scenarios to help people fully understand what goes through a linemen head in game. I also used sound effects to help the listener feel like they were actually in the action, with the crowd noise, and the grunts and set hut. 
I used a quote from offensive linemen Will Campbell which was posted by LSU media, and I also used an example from offensive line trainer Duke Manryweather of OL Masterminds
I think my overall understanding of how to use Audacity has improved, but I wish I would have chosen a topic that I could have used more statistical facts on instead of mostly opinionated statements. 
I used the professors advice of splitting up the clips instead of doing on big talking session so that it flows together much easier
