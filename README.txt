# Ryans Audio Narrative
 
Summary
-This is a podcast about football, but not just football. I am focusing on the most important aspect of the game of football, the trenches also known as the offensive line. I dive into some aspects of offensive linemen that I believe that people do not quite understand, and also that people need to learn.
